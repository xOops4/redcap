 == INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPGRADING REDCAP ==

1.) Copy all the files/folders inside the "redcap" folder in this zip file onto your web server and place them 
in your main REDCap directory (where the database.php file is located).

2.) Navigate to the REDCap Control Center in your browser. You should see a new green box at the top saying "Ready To Upgrade". 
Follow the link to the Upgrade Module, which will give you instructions for upgrading REDCap. (If the green box does not appear, 
then you can upgrade manually by navigating to the URL .../redcap_vX.X.X/upgrade.php, in which X.X.X is the new version to 
which you are upgrading.)


ENJOY!
