This is sometimes called one-to-many data collection, in which a project can have one or more repeating parts. For example, if each record in a hypothetical project represents a person, then one might have a repeating instrument for medications, one for family members, one or adverse events, and one for collecting data over multiple visits (or weekly surveys), so that each repeating element is connected to the overall record but can repeat independently of the other instruments. So if using repeating instruments or repeating events, each record in the project can have a different number of repeated instances of any given instrument or event. One record may have five medications, but another may have two or none, for example. Such flexibility makes this feature very powerful, and setting up repeating instruments and/or repeating events in a project is very quick and easy. The repeating instruments/events feature can be enabled and set up by clicking the Enable button in the Optional Modules section on the Project Setup page."

However, with the repeating instruments functionality, one does not need to specify how many repetitions will needed ahead of time; one can simply repeat an instrument an unlimited amount of times. It is important to note that multiple instruments in a project can be enabled as repeating instruments (even all of them, if one wishes). Projects utilizing the longitudinal module can have repeating instruments as well, in which one or more instruments on any defined event can be set to repeat within that event. The repeating instruments functionality behaves very much the same way in both classic and longitudinal projects."

This might be useful if one has several instruments whose data correlates together, such as completing multiple surveys back to back for a specific time-point or visit, for example. Previously, one may have had to create X number of identical events to capture repeating data for the instruments on those events (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, ...), but the repeating events feature makes this much simpler by allowing one to create only one single event that can be repeated in unlimited fashion."

And if the report contains data specifically from a repeating instrument (as opposed to a repeating event), then a field named 'redcap_repeat_instrument' will additionally be included that represents the instrument name that denotes to which instrument the row of data belongs. These two fields will only be included automatically in the report or data export if data originates from a repeating instrument or event.

If the user entered 'John' as their first name, then text for the next question would literally read as <b>'John, what is your date of birth?'</b>. In the same way, you could use [first_name] in your survey's survey completion text when the survey is completed, in which <b>'Thanks for taking our survey, [first_name]!'</b> would be displayed to the respondent as <b>'Thanks for taking our survey, John!'</b>."

This makes it very powerful to use for a variety of purposes. Regardless of where it is utilized, the format of variable names in field notation is always the same. If a variable is used on its own, it will simply be [variable], and if you wish to specify that field variable for a specific event (for longitudinal projects), you must prepend the unique event name - e.g., [event][variable]. If you are referencing a specific repeating instance of the field, you append (not prepend) the repeat instance number in brackets - e.g., [variable][2], in which the format is the same for both repeating instruments and repeating events. If you are referencing the second instance of a repeating event, for example, you would use the format [event][variable][2]. If you are wanting to determine if a certain option for a checkbox field is checked or not, you may include the checkbox option value inside parentheses which follow the variable name inside the brackets - e.g., [my_checkbox(4)]. All these components can be used together, if needed, such as if you want to reference checkbox option 3 that exists on the fifth instance of a repeating instrument on 'Event 1' - e.g., [event_1_arm_1][my_checkbox(3)][5]."

NOTE: The only difference between @SETVALUE and @DEFAULT is that @DEFAULT is only applied when an instrument has no data yet, whereas @SETVALUE will always be applied on an instrument, meaning that @SETVALUE will ALWAYS overwrite the value if a field value already exists.

			 The second parameter represents the offset number amount that should be added or subtracted. It can be a decimal number or integer.

Otherwise, if it is not a multiple choice field, it will instead provide a text box for entering the filter value."

If you have two filters with an AND  between them, for example,  that means that it will apply both of them together when filtering, but if you use OR, it will return results  that apply to just one or the other. In general, using AND will often constrict the results further by returning less data in the report than  when using OR."

Please note that any user that has 'Add/Edit Reports' user privileges will be able to view  *all* reports in the project. This does not cause any user rights conflicts because reports do not give users access to any data to  which they do not already have access. In other words, if a user was not given form-level access to a particular data  collection instrument, then they will still not be able to view data from that instrument inside any report. The same goes  if the user is assigned to a Data Access Group, in which case they will still only be able to view data from records in their  own DAG. So even though a user may have 'Add/Edit Reports' privileges and may thus be able to view reports to which they have not been  given explicit access, they will not be able to view data to which they do not already have access. So implementing user access for  a report is not quite the same as setting someone's user privileges. Reports merely act as a window, so to speak, for viewing a subset  of the data to which a user has access, in which user privileges are employed when viewing a report. But user access controls for a  report merely provide a way to display the reports on certain users' left-hand project menu and thus are different from setting a  user's user rights."

This might be used if somehow an invitation was scheduled by accident and you need to quickly delete it. NOTE: You must have checked the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox in order for the 'stop logic' to work. By having the checkbox checked, it means that every time a given record is saved or has data modified, REDCap will see if there is an invitation scheduled for this record/survey, and if so, it will then double check to see if this condition/logic is still true. If condition is no longer true, it will delete the invitation so that it never gets sent. And if the record is modified again later, in which the condition then becomes true again, then the invitation will get re-scheduled. Without the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox being checkbox, REDCap will leave the scheduled invitation as-is and never delete it."
survey_1260 = "The 'stop logic' could be a complex set of conditional logic, or it could be as simple as a single field in the project (i.e., the kill switch). For example, if you are wanting a survey invitation to be scheduled when a participant is at least 18 years old, your logic might be '[age] >= 18'. And if you want to add the 'stop logic' to be able to manually delete a scheduled invitation, you could have '[age] >= 18 and [remove_alert] <> 1', in which the field 'remove alert' is a Yes/No field. So in this instance, if you wanted to have the scheduled invitation deleted, you could simply go to the data entry form where the 'remove alert' field is located, and set it to 'Yes'. This can be done a variety of different ways. This is merely a simple example to introduce this concept. <b>Remember, the key to using 'stop logic' is that the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox MUST be checked.</b>"

This allows you to invite participants to take a survey by sending them an SMS text message and collect data directly in REDCap from their phone without the need for a webpage.

	<b>There are two ways REDCap currently works with Mosio:</b><br>
	1. SMS Surveys – Sending questions and getting replies via text message.<br>
	2. Alerts - Sending REDCap Survey links via text message.<br><br>
	More two-way text messaging capabilities (Interactive “TextChat,” SMS Appointment Reminders, etc) are being developed. The information below will help you with Setup and Configuration.
	For more assistance, visit the REDCap Help & FAQ page or on Mosio’s website: <a href='https://www.mosio.com/redcap-guide' target='_blank'><u>https://www.mosio.com/redcap-guide</u></a>.<br><br>
	<b>SETUP & CONFIGURATION:</b><br>
	After you’ve obtained a Mosio Account, enter your Mosio API Key on your REDCap project’s Project Setup page.<br><br>
	Everything is quite like administering a survey in REDCap, except you choose how your surveys are delivered, either as an SMS Survey or with Alerts & Notifications (sending the REDCap survey link via text message). Any or both delivery methods can be used in a single project. If your surveys are collecting PHI, using Alerts & Notifications to deliver a REDCap survey link is recommended.<br><br>
	<b>ALERTS & NOTIFICATIONS:</b><br>
	When creating a new alert on the Alerts & Notifications page, there will be a choice between Email and SMS. Choosing SMS will hide all email-specific settings (e.g., email subject, attachments), and it will reveal a phone number text box for entering the phone number(s) of all recipients of the alert. These alerts will still be triggered normally, but instead of sending the notification via email, it will send it as an SMS text message.<br><br>
	<b>SMS SURVEYS:</b><br>
	When participants take an SMS survey, questions are asked one at a time as an SMS text message conversation/thread. Participants can respond with any kind of alpha-numeric text for an SMS survey.<br><br>
	<b>NOTE ABOUT SMS SURVEYS:</b> Only REDCap Administrators are allowed to enable the option to initiate a SMS Survey. Like email, SMS is not considered a secure form of communication, so you may not want to administer SMS Surveys if the participant will be submitting identifying information (PHI or PII) unless you have been granted special permission from the participant to do so. Given such sensitive privacy issues, only your local REDCap administrator can enable the optional setting to use SMS surveys. Please notify your administrator about this if you wish to have this option enabled.<br><br>
	<b>SURVEY COMPATIBILITY:</b><br>
	Most of REDCap's survey features remain unchanged with SMS Surveys. These include enforcing required fields, validating fields, using branching logic, utilizing the Survey Queue for multiple surveys (only when Auto-Start is enabled), receiving email notifications and confirmations, accessing the Participant List, sending Automated Survey Invitations, implementing Stop Actions and using computer adaptive tests (CATs) downloaded from the REDCap Shared Library. However, the Survey Login feature is not compatible with SMS surveys.<br><br>
	<b>PRIVACY & DATA SECURITY INFO:</b><br>
	It is important to understand that this feature utilizes the third-party service Mosio.com, which means that all SMS messages will be routed through Mosio's servers. However, REDCap goes to great length to ensure that SMS transcriptions do not stay in Mosio's logs but are removed shortly after being completed. This is done for security and privacy concerns (e.g., HIPAA), in which your survey participants' phone numbers and their survey responses do not get permanently logged on Mosio's servers but instead remain securely in REDCap. Mosio is HIPAA and 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. For more information about how Mosio handles privacy and data security, you can request their privacy statement."

(Note: This assumes that the user has already created their data collection instruments and fields in their project.) There are two types of fields that may be mapped: 1) one-time data fields, and 2) temporal data fields. One-time data fields are those where data will only be stored one time in the source system, such as demography data. Conversely, temporal data fields are those where data may be collected many times over a period of time (e.g., labs, vitals, any kind of longitudinal data). When mapping temporal fields, you must also specify a REDCap date/datetime field that will be used for determining the window of time in which it should look when fetching data from the source system. It will determine the window of time in conjunction with the day offset value defined on the mapping page. For example, if the value of the mapped REDCap date/datetime field is 2001-11-29 and the day offset is 1 day, it will query the source system and return only data saved for the field from 2001-11-28 until 2001-11-30. Any source data outside of that range will be ignored during the adjudication process. It is important to note that the source data for a temporal field will NOT be fetched from the external source system UNLESS its associated REDCap date/datetime field has a value. Once a value is entered for the associated date/datetime field, source data will then be fetched for that temporal field."

For example, if you have 'last name' and 'date of birth' as source fields, you may choose them to be preview fields in your project, and thus when a value is entered in REDCap as the record identifier, if will then fetch and display the last name and date of birth of the person to validate their identity.

It is also possible for it to be implemented (as part of REDCap) in other compliance environments, including GCP, 21 CFR Part 11, and FISMA environments. Just as your data in REDCap is secure, so are your conversations. There's no need to use email or third-party chat apps for all your communication in your projects. You can just use REDCap Messenger as the central hub for all your team communication and file sharing. And the best part is that it's a built-in part of REDCap. So if you're already using REDCap for data collection, it just makes sense to use REDCap Messenger for all the communication that is a natural part of your data collection and your projects."

This might be used if somehow an alert was scheduled by accident and you need to quickly delete it. NOTE: You must have checked the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox in order for the 'stop logic' to work. By having the checkbox checked, it means that every time a given record is saved or has data modified, REDCap will see if there is an alert scheduled for this record, and if so, it will then double check to see if this condition/logic is still true. If condition is no longer true, it will delete the notification so that it never gets sent. And if the record is modified again later, in which the condition then becomes true again, then the notification will get re-scheduled. Without the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox being checkbox, REDCap will leave the scheduled alert as-is and never delete it."
alerts_35 = "The 'stop logic' could be a complex set of conditional logic, or it could be as simple as a single field in the project (i.e., the kill switch). For example, if you are wanting to schedule an alert when a participant is at least 18 years old, your logic might be '[age] >= 18'. And if you want to add the 'stop logic' to be able to manually delete a scheduled alert, you could have '[age] >= 18 and [remove_alert] <i> 1', in which the field 'remove alert' is a Yes/No field. So in this instance, if you wanted to have the scheduled alert deleted, you could simply go to the data entry form where the 'remove alert' field is located, and set it to 'Yes'. This can be done a variety of different ways. This is merely a simple example to introduce this concept. <b>Remember, the key to using 'stop logic' is that the 'ensure logic is still true' checkbox MUST be checked.</b>"

The missing codes should be coded just like the choices of a multiple choice field with <i>code + comma + label</i>, in which the codes  can only have letters, numbers, dots, dashes, and underscores (e.g., '-999, Not asked' or 'UNK, Unknown').

Since a missing data code is saved as the field value, this means that the field's missing data code can then be optionally exported in a data export or viewed in a report  (if you so choose - this is an option when creating a report).

For example, it you have an integer field where '-999' is a possible value, then you should not use -999 as a missing data code. This is because REDCap will not be able  to know if this is a real value or if it is a missing code used to denote that the field is blank.

This allows a field to still be 'blank' and have a missing code while being hidden by branching logic."
missing_data_18 = "LOGIC: Because missing data codes are stored as the literal field values, they may be used and referenced in logic throughout REDCap  (i.e., logic for report filters, Data Quality rules, Survey Queue, Automated Survey Invitations, branching logic). For example, if you want to display a field on a form only  if the previous field is blank and is marked with the missing data code 'NASK', your branching logic might be the folowing: [field] = 'NASK'. Additionally, a special  function 'isblankormissingcode()' may be used in logic as a catch-all for determining if a field's value is truly blank or if it contains a missing data code.  E.g. isblankormissingcode([age]), in which if age has a value of UNK (which might be a missing data code in a project),  then it will return TRUE. And if the field has any non-blank/non-null value that is also not a missing data code, it will return FALSE."

    and after collecting the consent of a few participants, a question is modified or added, which represents a new version of the form, so you might increment the version to '2' (and so forth).
    Using consent forms is an optional feature. Once e-Consent is enabled for a survey, you may add one or more consent forms (if needed), in which each consent form must be given a version.
    The e-Consent 'custom tag/category' is another optional setting that is a free-form text field that is just a text label that you might want to display in the PDF footer to signify the type of e-Consent that
